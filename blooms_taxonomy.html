        <h3>Creation</h3>
        <p>Generating:<br>
Looking through various technologies we ran across D3 and liked the idea of being able to dynamically represent data online.  Not only could the data be presented attractively, but it was also interactive.  Both of us having worked on a project where this technology would have been incredibly useful, we saw the advantages immediately. 
	We knew we needed to show off this technology and show a strong understanding.  The first thing we did was look through all the examples available on the D3 website to generate ideas.  From there we found different examples that really sparked our interest and provided opportunity to show higher levels of understanding of the subject matter.   To keep things diverse we came up with five different examples: bar chart, stack chart, choropleth map, ring chart, tournament tree. <br><br>
            Planning:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Find examples that showed off particular aspects of D3 and sparked personal interest</li>
            <li>Continue research based on examples</li>
            <li>Meet and split up examples</li>
            <li>Work through the different designs and decide on extra interactive conditions</li>
            <li>Periodic status updates/ask questions</li>
            <li>Combine examples</li>
            <li>Write report</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            Producing:<br>
            From personal experience we chose to use Brackets as our editor.  We were able to directly code and apply what we learned from examples and research.

        <h3>Evaluation</h3>
        <p>Checking:<br>
	Because of the nature of the project we could get instant feedback via visual confirmation.  As we chose to use brackets as our editor, we were able to easily check our work.  The editor allows for a live preview that will demonstrate our code on a live local internet host.  With this constant and immediate feedback, we could easily see if we were coding in the right direction or if we needed to try something new.  Along with our personal guesses on what the code should do and other examples we found, both online and text book, we knew if we needed to do more research or ask for help.<br><br>
	Another strategy we employed was to print different pieces of code or data to the console log.  The nature of the code made it so we at times could only assume what values certain variables held.  By printing these guesses to the console log we could confirm our guesses and follow the data throughout the running code.  The difference allowed for more complex code as we could verify the data manipulation and identify when our code hit errors.  
	The most important way we checked our code in the beginning is via the examples and the research we found.  The examples aloud for a base frame we could base our project on and implement our unique conditions.  The examples allowed us to check our grammar and possible ideas for our code.  If we couldn’t find a reason our code would not run and the editor tools error didn’t make sense, comparing our code with similar working code became invaluable. <br><br>
Critiquing:<br>
	The example code also served as a way we could critique our code.  If we found similar code to what we were trying to produce, we could gauge best practices and code simplicity.  If they were able to accomplish the same thing we were in 25 few lines of code, we knew we could improve our style or attempt the problem in a new way.  On the other side of the coin we could see how well we were doing by how nice our code was vs the examples and research.  We could see the how readable our code was and discover our coding style by using what made sense to us; implementing best practices discovered from research and examples,   reading other people’s code, and taking what we’ve learned from different projects.  In this way the examples acted as a silent and constant critique.<br><br>
	Another way we critiqued ourselves was by sharing our code between each other.  When sharing we could see our partners work and share what we learned.  If we say a mistake or a better way of doing something, we could immediately bring up the issue and see if it was a better answer to the problem or prove as the viable solution.
