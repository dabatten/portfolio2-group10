        <h3>Creation</h3>
        <p>Generating:<br>
Looking through various technologies we ran across D3 and liked the idea of being able to dynamically represent data online.  Not only could the data be presented attractively, but it was also interactive.  Both of us having worked on a project where this technology would have been incredibly useful, we saw the advantages immediately. 
	We knew we needed to show off this technology and show a strong understanding.  The first thing we did was look through all the examples available on the D3 website to generate ideas.  From there we found different examples that really sparked our interest and provided opportunity to show higher levels of understanding of the subject matter.   To keep things diverse we came up with five different examples: bar chart, stack chart, choropleth map, ring chart, tournament tree. <br><br>
            Planning:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Find examples that showed off particular aspects of D3 and sparked personal interest</li>
            <li>Continue research based on examples</li>
            <li>Meet and split up examples</li>
            <li>Work through the different designs and decide on extra interactive conditions</li>
            <li>Periodic status updates/ask questions</li>
            <li>Combine examples</li>
            <li>Write report</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            Producing:<br>
            From personal experience we chose to use Brackets as our editor.  We were able to directly code and apply what we learned from examples and research.

        <h3>Evaluation</h3>
        <p>Checking:<br>
	Because of the nature of the project we could get instant feedback via visual confirmation.  As we chose to use brackets as our editor, we were able to easily check our work.  The editor allows for a live preview that will demonstrate our code on a live local internet host.  With this constant and immediate feedback, we could easily see if we were coding in the right direction or if we needed to try something new.  Along with our personal guesses on what the code should do and other examples we found, both online and text book, we knew if we needed to do more research or ask for help.<br><br>
	Another strategy we employed was to print different pieces of code or data to the console log.  The nature of the code made it so we at times could only assume what values certain variables held.  By printing these guesses to the console log we could confirm our guesses and follow the data throughout the running code.  This allowed for more complex code as we could verify the manipulation of data and identify when our code hit errors. <br><br> 
	The most important way we checked our code in the beginning is via the examples and the research we found.  The examples were a base frame for our project and implement our unique conditions.  The examples allowed us to check our grammar and possible ideas for our code.  If we couldn’t find a reason our code would not run and the editor tools error didn’t make sense, comparing our code with similar working code became invaluable. <br><br>
Critiquing:<br>
	The example code also served as a way we could critique our code.  If we found similar code to what we were trying to produce, we could gauge best practices and code simplicity.  If they were able to accomplish the same thing we were in as little as 25 lines of code, we knew we could improve our style or attempt the problem in a new way.  On the other side of the coin we could see how well we were doing by how nice our code was vs the examples and research.  We could see how readable our code was and discover our coding style by using what made sense to us; implementing best practices discovered from research and examples, reading other people’s code, and taking what we’ve learned from different projects.  In this way the examples acted as a silent and constant critique.<br><br>
	Another way we critiqued ourselves was by sharing our code between each other.  When sharing we could see our partners work and share what we learned.  If we say a mistake or a better way of doing something, we could immediately bring up the issue and see if it was a better answer to the problem or prove as the viable solution.

        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p>Differentiating:<br>
	Using D3 gave an interesting issue.  The D3 libraries built on existing elements in the HTML and other libraries.  Also the syntax was very similar to JQuery.  Being able to distinguish between all the different elements of the project was essential for success.  Not only did we need to know D3 and how to implement the desired changes, but we needed to know the other technologies D3 depends on.  Many times the answer to a particular problem we had didn’t lie in the D3 sections, but in the different elements associated with that section of code.  We also had to identify what each section of code controlled and what errors might occur with each section.  This became very important as we made our code more and more segmented.<br><br>
	When problem solving we had to follow the errors through our code and decide what type of error it was and the different possible solutions.  Is the error a coding error or is it a user error?  Is the problem HTML or SVG?  These are only a few of the issues we encountered. Differentiating between them and finding the correct line of reason was essential. <br><br>
Organizing:<br>
	Organizing our project became very simple as we talked about how we wanted to present our project.  We wanted to be able to show and describe the different examples at the same time.  Thus we came up with the online presentation.  We set up an interactive table of contents with our introduction on the first page and hyperlinks to each of the examples.  Because we initially attempted the project in example chunks, the separation of ideas and concerns flowed naturally. We could focus on one point of the project per page allowing for more precision of ideas and faster navigation.<br><br>
	Also we could organize each example into separation of concerns. Each had an HTML document (view), a JavaScript document (controller), and a either a CSV or JSON document (model).
